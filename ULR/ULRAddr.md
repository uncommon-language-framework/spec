# ULRAddr Specification

Addresses in `void** ulraddr` (aka `void* ulraddr[]`) should show up sequentially, in the same order that the members they correspond to show up in the [metadata (`char* ulr_meta`)](./Metadata.md). For method declarations (including ctors and dtors), the address of the method should be placed in the array as a `void*`. For static field declarations, a pointer to (the address of) the static field should be placed in the array as a `void*`. For instance field declarations, the offset of the field from the object base should be placed in the metadata. This should take virtual pointers into account (e.g. reference types must add the +8 or +4 (pointer size) offset to all of their instance field offsets). For property declarations, place the method addresses of whichever methods were implemented for the property (get/set) in the array as `void*`s; if both the getter and the setter are implemented, the getter should always precede the setter. For field declarations in unfilled generic types, place a `nullptr`. For any method (even property getter/setter method) declarations in unfilled generic types, place a C-style string of ULR-compilant generic LLVM IR for runtime generic type generation in the array casted to a `void*`.
